;; From hlissner/doom-emacs

;; Emacs HEAD (27+) introduces early-init.el, which is run before init.el,
;; before package and UI initialization happens.

;; Defer garbage collection further back in the startup process

;; Package initialize occurs automatically, before `user-init-file' is
;; loaded, but after `early-init-file'. Doom handles package
;; initialization, so we must prevent Emacs from doing it early!
